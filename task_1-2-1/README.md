# Client-Server-Communication-using-node.js-and-socket.io

This is a project to transfer data between server and client in Node.JS using socket.io.

You can download the folder and run the app.js file. 

In the 'index.html' file (client side) you will find a textarea where you can enter a name. The client side then sends it to the server side using socket.io connection. Upon recieving the name the server side returns a message saying "Hello <name>". 


We can accomplish much more complex functions using socket.io with Node.js. This is just to demonstrate how to establish the connection and transfer data using socket.io.
